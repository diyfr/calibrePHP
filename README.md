# CalibrePHP

It's a udapted version of [CalibrePHP](https://github.com/openam/calibrephp/) for Ubuntu 16.04 and PHP 7.0 (using CakePHP(tm) v 0.2.9 )  

This is a simple [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [OPDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPDS) web server to access a database created by the [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com) application. CalibrePHP was written using [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org).

## Docker
This application is also available as a docker container. You can run this application and expose your local Calibre library into the docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name calibrephp \
  -p 8888:80 \
  -e BASE_URL=default \
  --restart="always" \
  -v <path-to-your-calibre-library>:/library \
  openam/calibrephp
```

This will make the application available on port 8888 on the dockerhost. You can then change the `Alternate book path` setting to `/library/metadata.db` which will use the library volume provided to the container.

The `BASE_URL` is optional, but allows you to access your files via `http://dockerhost:8888/default`
